    "\n",
    "The advantages of support vector machines are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "* Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "* Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "* Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages of support vector machines include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial.\n",
    "* SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation (see Scores and probabilities, below).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform non-linear classifications using the **kernel trick**, elevating and mapping the inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many paramters, some of which are very sensitive. Some of the most important SVM parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **C :** float, optional (default=1.0). Penalty parameter C of the error term.\n",
    "* **kernel :** string, optional (default=’rbf’). Specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm. \n",
    "    It must be one of ‘linear’, ‘poly’, ‘rbf’, ‘sigmoid’, ‘precomputed’ or a callable. If none is given, ‘rbf’ will be used. If a callable is given it is used to pre-compute the kernel matrix from data matrices; that matrix should be an array of shape (n_samples, n_samples).\n",
    "* **gamma :** float, optional (default=’auto’). Kernel coefficient for ‘rbf’, ‘poly’ and ‘sigmoid’. If gamma is ‘auto’ then 1/n_features will be used instead.\n",
